[https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.k6djh9wd0](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.k6djh9wd0)

The dataset contains 71,888 images of 4,144 species in 884 genera, 74 families, 26 orders, and six subclasses; all 74 families are covered in the phylogenetic study by Bieler et al. (2014).

## Description of the data and file structure

The Images are inside the images.zip file. Metadata is located inside the meta.tsv file. Code is located in the respective code folder.

## Sharing/Access information

Images are prohibited to share. Password can be provided for research purpose.
